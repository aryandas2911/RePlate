# RePlate
Developed at BVP-HEX 2024, RePlate connects restaurants with charities to reduce food waste. Using JS, HTML, and CSS, the platform provides real-time data to optimize food donations and pick-ups. This hackathon project taught me valuable skills in development, teamwork, and creating impactful solutions.
