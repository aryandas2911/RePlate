# 🥘 Replate

A smart and efficient food waste management platform that connects restaurants with nearby charities and food banks to redistribute surplus food in real-time and reduce food insecurity.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Every day, restaurants and food businesses dispose of large quantities of edible food due to logistical barriers, lack of coordination, and the absence of real-time donation systems. Simultaneously, millions of people in urban and rural areas go to bed hungry. Existing food donation mechanisms are fragmented, inefficient, and often fail to match surplus food with those in need in time. Replate aims to bridge this gap by creating a platform that connects food donors, NGOs, and volunteers in real-time to ensure that surplus food reaches the needy instead of ending up in landfills.
